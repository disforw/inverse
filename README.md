# Inverse Switch
Create an inverse switch from a Home Assistant switch entity.

This custom integration will add a helper option called "Inverse Switch"
which will allow you to select an existing switch and create a new entity
that is inverted. This custom integration will replace the need to use
a template in YAML in order to accomplish the same thing.


Access this feature from the Home Assistant Helper menu.
